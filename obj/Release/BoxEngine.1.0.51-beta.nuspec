    <description>Box is a simple game engine for building 2D games in .NET.</description>
    <releaseNotes>- Improved Renderer and RenderTarget performance, resulting in a 40% increase in frame rate.
    - Improved SaveTypeWriterReader: It will now attempt to compress files if the compressed size is smaller; otherwise, it will default to an uncompressed format.
    - Fixed and improved Sound Manager:
    --- All SoundManager.Play methods now return a SoundInstance, allowing you to set up transitions or other effects.
    --- Sound assets can now be set to always loop, eliminating the need to use blocking to keep them playing on a channel.
    --- Removed channel blocking, which also led to the removal of fade-in and fade-out functionality.
    --- Added functionality to check if a sound is playing on a channel based on either the sound asset or the sound instance.
    --- Added sound instance pan and sound channel pan, allowing sounds to be adjusted to play through the left or right speaker.
    --- Improved Master Channel behavior to function properly across all channels.
    - New Input System Features:
    --- Expanded Axis Input Handling:
    ------ Added GetKeyAxisPressed, GetKeyAxisReleased, and GetKeyAxisJustPressed for keyboard input.
    ------ Added GetGamepadAxisPressed, GetGamepadAxisReleased, and GetGamepadAxisJustPressed for gamepad input.
    --- Improved Action Handling:
    ------ Added action-based axis detection for gamepads and keyboards.
    ------ Supports IsActionPressed, IsActionReleased, and IsActionJustPressed for more precise input tracking.
    - Fixed a bug where the FPS counter incorrectly displayed 30 FPS, even when the actual frame rate was much higher.
    - Object Pool hs been updated to version 9.0.0.
    - Fixed a bug with bitmap font line height. Text now renders correctly and aligns as intended. 
    - Added ChildrenAs to improve child entity handling based on a type.
    - Added Camera Zoom
    - Bug with resizing the window.
    - Fixed a bug where enum arrays weren't appearing correctly in the map settings.
    - Fixed Rand.Range(int min, int max) to be inclusive of max
    - Updated Rand.Range(float min, float max) to properly include max
    - Ensured consistent clamping behavior in FloatRange and IntRange
    - Added FloatRange and IntRange structs for clamped value handling with min/max bounds
    - Improved value clamping and percent normalization in range types
    - Improved Entity property setters for Size, GlobalPosition, Visible, and Layer
    --- Now avoids redundant updates using distance/equals checks
		- Added support for DropTable system: load item drops from external `.table` files located in the `Tables/` directory.
		- Introduced DropTableDirectory class to manage, parse, and evaluate drop tables at runtime.
		- DropTables support weighted entries, quantity ranges, and roll modifiers.
		- Integrated into engine-level asset loading for easy reuse across entities, chests, and enemy types.
		- Added TimerTrigger to Box.Entities.Triggers. This entity triggers a callback after a specified duration. Supports one-shot or repeating modes and can be auto-started. Includes chainable methods: Start(), Stop(), Restart().
		- Added GridPanel for dynamic grid-based layout of entities. Supports configurable columns, spacing, alignment, and optional auto-sizing.</releaseNotes>
