    <description>Box is a simple game engine for building 2D games in .NET.</description>
    <releaseNotes>- Singletons Replaced: The old Singleton pattern has been removed and replaced with a more flexible Service system.
		- Service Instances: The following Singleton instances have been removed:
		--- Engine
		--- Log
		--- Rand
		--- Clock
		--- Assets
		--- Signal
		--- Renderer
		--- Coroutine
		--- SoundManager
		--- ScreenManager
		- These have now been refactored into the Service system for better management and scalability.
		- Service States: Added different states for services:
		- New states for updating and initialization were introduced.
		- Services can now be passively drawn, improving the overall flexibility for handling various service types.
		- Service Collection Manager: Introduced Service Collection and Service Manager to better organize and manage the lifecycle of services.
		- Fluent Interface: A Fluent Interface has been added to streamline the process of configuring engine settings with error checking for safer and more intuitive configurations.
		- Service Attribute: The SingletonAttribute has been replaced with the new ServiceAttribute to reflect the updated service management approach.</releaseNotes>
